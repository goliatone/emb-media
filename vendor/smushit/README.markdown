smushit-php
=========

A PHP wrapper around Yahoo!'s [Smush.it image compression web service](http://www.smushit.com/ysmush.it/).

Given a URL to an image or a local image filename, this class will losslessly compress the image using Yahoo!'s Smush.it service and return the URL to the smushed image along with its meta information. It can optionally overwrite the local image file.

Much love to the Yahoo! [Exceptional Performance group](http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/exceptional-performance/) for a wonderful service :-)

EXAMPLES
--------

    $img = new SmushIt('http://some-domain.com/image.jpg');
    print_r($img); // Will output...
    // SmushIt Object
	// (
	//     [filename] => 
	//     [url] => http://some-domain.com/image.jpg
	//     [compressedUrl] => http://smushit.zenfs.com/results/dcd75d06/smush/image.jpg
	//     [size] => 42517
	//     [compressedSize] => 23063
	//     [savings] => 45.76
	//     [error] => 
	// )
